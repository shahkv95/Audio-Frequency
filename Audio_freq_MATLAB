Audio signals are usually composed of different frequencies.
For example, in music, the note 'middle C' has a frequency of 261.6 Hz, & 
most music consists of several notes (or frequencies) being played at the same time.

Typically, the frequencies that make up a signal are different enough that they do not interfere substantially with each other.

However, when a signal contains two frequencies that are close together, 
they can cause the signal to appear to have a 'beat' - a pulsing pattern in the amplitude.


fs - represents the sampling frequency of the audio signal.
t  - represents the times when the audio signal was sampled.
y  - represent the audio signal amplitude at each sampled time.
Since the y vector contains the sum of two sine waves with similar frequencies, you will see a 'beat' pattern.
Plot the y vector (y-axis) against the t vector (x-axis).
A Fourier transform returns information about the frequency content of the signal. 
So fft function is used to compute the discrete Fourier transform of a vector.
numel function is used to return the number of elements in an array.
The fft function in MATLAB uses only the sampled data to compute the Fourier transform. 
The f variable will represent the frequencies that correspond to the values in yfft.
The output values from fft are complex numbers. To plot their magnitude, the abs function is used.

INPUT CODE:

fs = 10
t  = 0:1/fs:20
y  = sin(1.8*2*pi*t) + sin(2.1*2*pi*t)
plot(t,y)
yfft = fft(y)
n = numel(y)
f = 0:fs/n:fs*(n-1)/n
plot(f,abs(yfft))

CONCLUSION:

Notice the two spikes on the left side of the plot which correspond to the frequencies of the two sine waves you created earlier. 
Since the spikes are close together, the signal exhibits the beat phenomenon.

Why are there four spikes? That relates to the Nyquist frequency, which in this case is 5 (or fs/2). 
When the input vector consists of real numbers, the fft function always returns data whose magnitude is symmetric about the 
Nyquist frequency. That is, the second half of the plot (after the Nyquist frequency) is just a mirror image of the first half.
